[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/arachne-framework/arachne-assets.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/arachne-framework/arachne-assets)

This Arachne module which provides support for asset pipelines and static site generation.

# Possible Enhancements:

- Transform could be implemented slightly more cleanly/flexibly in terms of transducers
 - Create a more low-level, async transform that operates on input/output channels directly (but still handles dists for you)

## WARNING

This repository is not yet ready for public consumption. Many key
elements will change before Arachne is ready to be used, even just for
experimentation.

The repository has been made public so people can follow the
development process, and to make CI integration easier, but it would
be foolish and counterproductive to try to actually use it, or even
play around with it just yet.

Stay tuned for this warning to disappear, then have at it :)
